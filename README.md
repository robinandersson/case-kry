# Kry Code Assignment

This is Robin Andersson's submission for the Kry/Livi frontend case, as part of the hiring process.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run css:build`

Compiles the src css files in src/styles and outputs the build to src/index.build.css.

Observe that the js:build/js:start bundles and minifies the css even further (this step should be piped in to CRA's build setup)

### `npm run css:watch`

Same as css:build, but also watches for changes.

Observe that the js:build/js:start bundles and minifies the css even further (this step should be piped in to CRA's build setup)

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
